Definition list

Term 1
: Lists are frequently used to define terms or concepts, and in Pandoc you can create
  definition lists by following a term with a colon and indenting the start of the
  definition with a tab or at least four spaces. So you can create definition lists like
  this
: Definition 1

Term 2
: Definition 2

Term 1
: Defintion 1
: Defintion 11

Term 2
: Defintion 2
