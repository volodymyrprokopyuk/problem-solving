# PostgreSQL

- Query
  - `WITH [RECURSIVE] _ AS` named subquery can be used in other named subqueries
  - `SELECT DISTINCT ON (...)` computed value, column alias `c`, `agg_func(DISTINCT
    ... ORDER BY ...)`
  - `FROM` table alias `t`, `t(c)`
    - `JOIN` restrict both relations
    - `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` keep one relation and enrich with the other if
      matches, otherwise `NULL`
    - `FULL JOIN` keep both relations
    - `CROSS JOIN`=`t1, t2` Cartesian product
    - Join conditions `ON expression`, `USING (list)`
    - `JOIN LATERAL (SELECT ... WHERE ...)` restrict subquery to the current row in
      `FROM` `ON true`. Run the subquery in a loop for each row in `FROM`. Push down
      the join condition into the subquery
  - `WHERE` no alias, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IN (...)`, `EXISTS (SELECT 1 ...)`
    - Anti-join `WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 ...)`
    - Row comparator/assignment `(a, b) = (c, d)`
  - `GROUP BY` alias
    - `GROUPING SETS ((...), ())`=`GROUP` data separately `BY` each `GROUPING SET` and
      then `UNION` with appropriate `NULL`. Aggregate over more than one group at the
      same time in a single query scan
    - `ROLLUP` all prefixes for hierarchical data analysis
    - `CUBE` all subsets (power set)
  - `HAVING` no alias
  - `WINDOW _ AS (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ... ROWS PRECEDING | CURRENT | FOLLOWING
    EXCLUDE)` for each input row a frame of peer rows sharing a common property is
    available. Different `OVER` definitions can be used in the same query even with
    `GROUP BY`
  - `ORDER BY` alias `ASC | DESC`
  - `LIMIT n` never use `OFFSET m` use `FETCH` cursor instead
- Set operations `UNION [ALL]`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT` combine query result sets
- Three-valuded logic `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL` + `=`, `<>`
  - `IS DISTINCT FROM` two-valued logic with `NULL`
- Conditional `CASE _ WHEN _ THEN _ ELSE _ END`
- Aggregate function `count(*) FILTER (WHERE ...)`
  - `CREATE AGGREGATE <agg> (type, ...) (
       SFUNC = state transition function (previous state, current row arguments) new state
       STYPE = state value data type
       INITCOND = state initial value
       FINALFUNC = transform the final state value into the aggregate output value)`
- `WITH ... INSERT INTO ... VALUES | SELECT (JOIN ...) ON CONFLICT ... DO NOTHING | DO
  UPDATE SET ... EXCLUDED RETURNING *`
- `WITH ... UPDATE ... SET ... FROM (JOIN ...) WHERE ... RETURNING *`
- `WITH ... DELETE FROM ... USING (JOIN ...) WHERE ... RETURNING *`
- `TRUNCATE ...`
- **Normalization**. Reduces data redundacy, improves data consistency, allows to extend
  the data model without changing existing tables (DDL)
  - **Anomalies**
    - **Update anomaly**. Multiple rows has to be updated with the same data
    - **Insertion anomaly**. More than necessary data has to be inserted
    - **Deletion anomaly**. More than necessary data has to be deleted
  - **Normalization forms** (split tables using identity PK, many-to-one FK and
    many-to-many pivot table)
    - **1NF**. Every attribute value must be atomic
    - **2NF**. Every non-candidate key attribute must depend on the whole candidate key
    - **3NF**. Transtivie dependencies between attributes must be removed
- **Transactions**. Lower isolaiton, fewer locks, more concurrency, more
  phenomena. Highter isolation, more locks, less concurrency, less phenomena (TCL, DML)
  - **Phenomena**
    - **Dirty read**. A transaction reads data written by a concurrent uncommitted
      transaction
    - **Nonrepeatable read**. A transaction re-reads data and finds that data has been
      updated by another transaction that commited after the initial read (`UPDATE` +
      `COMMIT`)
    - **Phantom read**. A transaction re-reads data and finds that data has been
      inserted or deleted by another transaction that commited after the initial read
      (`INSERT`, `DELETE` + `COMMIT`)
    - **Serialization anomaly**
  - **Isolation levels**
    - **Read committed**
    - **Repeatable read**
    - **Serializable**
